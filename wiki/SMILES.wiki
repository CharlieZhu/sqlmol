SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is a line notation (a typographical method using printable characters) for entering and representing molecules and reactions. 

==SMILES is spanning tree==
  In terms of a graph-based computational procedure, SMILES is a string obtained by printing the symbol nodes encountered in a depth-first tree traversal of a chemical graph. The chemical graph is first trimmed to remove hydrogen atoms and cycles are broken to turn it into a spanning tree. Where cycles have been broken, numeric suffix labels are included to indicate the connected nodes. Parentheses are used to indicate points of branching on the tree.

SMILES 是生成树(spanning tree)结构
树状结构通用的关系表达方法
    ( nodeid[PK], parent-nodeid, nodecontents )
树枝/连接是有实际意义的，是atom间的bond
    ( nodeid[PK], parent-nodeid, nodecontents, bond )
node
    ( nodeid[PK], code ) nodeid= str-index-in-smiles, code-len= LEN(code)

( nodeid, code, parent-nodeid, bond )
