===Direction of bonds===
Bond table generated from `fn_sqlmol_smi2tbl` as
{{{
nodeid, code, pnodeid, bond, bondid
}}}
`nodeid` appears after `pnodeid` in the SMILES string.

Protocol shared between compound data generation and query generation
Bond in compound is also a tuple
{{{
bond_type, n1, n2, bondid
}}}
n1 and n2 is nodeid. Code of n1 is smaller of equal than code of n2.
If two nodes on a bond have the same code (is same element), n1 is the later one that appears in SMILES string.

{{{
-- compound bonds
insert into sqlmol_compound_bonds(compoundid, btid, ceid1, ceid2)
select
	@cid,
	(select btid from sqlmol_bond_type where symbol= b.bond_type),
	case when e1.atom<= e2.atom then e1.ceid else e2.ceid end,
	case when e1.atom<= e2.atom then e2.ceid else e1.ceid end
from 
	@bonds b ,
	sqlmol_compound_elements e1,
	sqlmol_compound_elements e2
where
	e1.compoundid=@cid and e2.compoundid=@cid
	and b.nodeid=e1.nodeid
	and b.pnodeid=e2.nodeid
